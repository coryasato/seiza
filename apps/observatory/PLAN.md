# PLAN.md — Observatory

What's next for the Observatory: milestone status, the active milestone's "done when" checks, long-term goals, and open questions. Only what's still open lives here. The rules are the root `CLAUDE.md`'s, its "Comparison protocol" above all; this app's own are in its [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md).

**Goal:** one page, at `seiza.io/observatory`, that runs each component against a DOM equivalent and shows with measured numbers what each costs over a session of use: opening data, scrolling, flinging, jumping. The first comparison is GPUI | TanStack: the tall table ([`components/tall-table/`](../../components/tall-table/), at `seiza.io/observatory/tall-table`) against React + TanStack Virtual, on the same engine and the same file.

**Deciding metrics:** per-use cost, as the root `CLAUDE.md`'s "Comparison protocol" defines it (time to first usable, time to data, input to visible response, behavior under load, reach and correctness, cost). One-time costs (first pixels, bundle size) are footnotes. TTFP still gates each contender's own build (root rule 1).

**Where everything else lives:** the decisions so far are repo-wide, in the root [`docs/DECISIONS.md`](../../docs/DECISIONS.md) ("Comparison protocol", "Hosting", "Repo structure"). This app's own context and rules are in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md), its decisions in [`docs/DECISIONS.md`](docs/DECISIONS.md).

## Status

| Milestone | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|
| M0 | Groundwork: the app, its data file, and static hosting (parts A–B) | Done 2026-10-14 ([`docs/milestones.md`](docs/milestones.md)) |
| M1 | Spikes: the DOM scroll model and the input-latency method (parts A–B) | Done 2026-10-15 ([`docs/milestones.md`](docs/milestones.md)) |
| M2 | The GPUI contender and the fixtures (parts A–C) | Done 2026-10-17 ([`docs/milestones.md`](docs/milestones.md)) |
| M3 | The TanStack contender (parts A–D) | Done 2026-10-18 ([`docs/milestones.md`](docs/milestones.md)) |
| M4 | The numbers: cold runs of both contenders (parts A–B) | Done 2026-10-18 ([`docs/milestones.md`](docs/milestones.md)) |
| M5 | The observatory page (parts 0, A, A1–A2, B, C, D1–D4) | Done 2026-10-21 ([`docs/milestones.md`](docs/milestones.md)) |
| M6 | The deploy | Done 2026-10-21 ([`docs/milestones.md`](docs/milestones.md)) |

**Parts are sized to one working session.** Each ends with its own checks passing and its evidence written down, so the next session starts from this file, not from the last one's context. A part that grows past a session splits before it's started, not halfway through.

**Closing a milestone:** as for every app (root `CLAUDE.md`, "Working agreements"): every "done when" check passes; the numbers are in `perf/results/` with a note; new decisions are in `docs/DECISIONS.md` (repo-wide ones in the root's); a `docs/LESSONS.md` entry is written; and the milestone's spec and evidence move from here to `docs/milestones.md`, leaving one row above.

**Component and engine changes:** the observatory consumes the tall table and the DuckDB engine; it doesn't reshape them (root `docs/DECISIONS.md`, "Repo structure"). The changes it needs, all listed here (each done, and recorded in `docs/milestones.md`): `Paging` gains the two settle times (M2 part A, the one change to the table's internals, defaults unchanged), the table's fixtures and their native tests (M2 part C, with `shown_text` split out of the render loop for them, and `seiza-duckdb`'s `summary_queries` returning the queries `open_parquet` sends), `@seiza/duckdb` takes its extension directory as an option (done, M0 part A), and `seiza` gains a `panel` feature (on by default) while its title bar and theme toggle move to Tycho, with the Mac input bindings opt-in (M2 part A), and `seiza::targets` (publishing a control's bounds) moves there from Tycho, as do Tycho's first-draw probe and placeholder screenshot match to `shared-web/perf/` (M2 part B), and `cells.json` gains two hand-written `rounding` cases (M3 part A: fixture data only, no code). Each records its effect on Tycho.

**Waiting on** (features of a component or engine the observatory needs; only that crate's `PLAN.md` builds them, and the session that closes one flips its row to *Ready*):

| Needs | For | Status |
|---|---|---|
| tall-table `custom-cells` ([its PLAN](../../components/tall-table/PLAN.md), "Drawing") | The wide sheet's heat and bar cells; market watch's flash on change | *Not ready* (tall-table M2, after M1's bare host) |
| tall-table `live` ([its PLAN](../../components/tall-table/PLAN.md), "Asked for by the observatory's scenarios") | Market watch | *Not ready* |
| tall-table `follow` (same) | Live tail | *Not ready* |

## Active milestone

None: M6, the deploy, closed 2026-10-21 ([`docs/milestones.md`](docs/milestones.md)). Next is the first scenario, the wide sheet ("Long-term goals", "Scenarios"). It waits on the table's `custom-cells` ("Waiting on", above; tall-table M2, the table's second milestone); its checks are drafted once that's ready.

The table's base at the wide sheet's 500 columns (tall-table M1, [its results](../../components/tall-table/perf/results/2026-10-23-m1.md), where the numbers are): it keeps up at the reference run, sideways as smoothly as down, but at its 120 px columns and 30 px rows only a few hundred cells are on screen, far fewer than the wide sheet assumed, and at 4× CPU a steady scroll drops frames in both shapes. Denser stops need narrower columns and shorter rows, settings the base lacks: the wide sheet's plan asks the table for them.

## Long-term goals

Not milestones. Each starts with research.

- **Scenarios:** the comparison is led by real uses, not feature sets. A scenario is a kind of app people build (its workload, built from a feature level of the table on both sides, a dataset or a deterministic feed, a script, and a few intensity stops, each with cold numbers), and it answers a visitor's question: for this table, the DOM or WebAssembly on the GPU? The page shows a scenario picker and one dial over its stops; an advanced panel of a scenario's parameters is a later toggle, labelled warm. In build order: **wide sheet** (hundreds of columns, heat and bar cells), **market watch** (cells updated in place at high rates), **live tail** (rows appended while following the tail), the **admin table** (the control, where the DOM wins: capabilities more than speed), and the **monitoring wall** (many tables at once), last. The mechanisms, each scenario's workload, measures, dial, and needs: [`docs/research/scenarios.md`](docs/research/scenarios.md). The features each needs are the table's ([`components/tall-table/PLAN.md`](../../components/tall-table/PLAN.md), "Asked for by the observatory's scenarios"); the root protocol gains the scenario with the first one's milestone.
- **A third contender: Glide Data Grid** (GPUI | TanStack / Glide): a DOM-hosted canvas grid, which would separate "canvas vs DOM" from "Wasm vs JS" (the scenarios' mechanisms A against B and C, [`docs/research/scenarios.md`](docs/research/scenarios.md)). Another contender app against the same GPUI side, under the same protocol. It may never happen.
- **A dataset easier to read at a glance** than a sea of floats, within the static-asset budget. The wide sheet's heat and bar cells answer part of it.
- **Feature levels:** a level adds a table feature on both sides (root `CLAUDE.md`, "Comparison protocol"), each feature's cost measured against the base. A level comes in with the scenario that needs it, not on its own. The features, their order, and each one's TanStack counterpart are in [the table's `PLAN.md`](../../components/tall-table/PLAN.md); a level is a milestone here that links to it.
- **The benchmark button:** "Run benchmark" plays a scripted session on each side in turn (the order alternated between runs), drives each through its own input path (script-made wheel events reach GPUI's listeners but never scroll a native scroller, so the DOM side is driven through its scroll position), and shows the results labelled warm beside the cold ones, from production too. Deferred: at the base level its session (load, fling, jump to 90%) replays what the cold numbers already show, a workload on which the GPUI side reads mostly as heavier in memory. It's worth building once the scenarios exist: it then sweeps a scenario's stops on each side and draws each side's curve, where each one stops keeping up. The status bar keeps it, disabled.
- **Dropping your own file:** out of the base level. It would widen the cell fixtures to every column kind (decimals, timestamps, 128-bit integers). Opening any dataset (a dropped file, HuggingFace) is Tycho's, as a utility app's job.

## Open questions

- **The DOM's fling, read from its compositor.** The fling's late frames and lag are main-thread readings on both sides (`underLoad`), which on GPUI are the presented frames but on the DOM aren't: its compositor scrolls on through a late main-thread frame. The README says so. Whether the DOM side should also report what its compositor presented (`cc`'s frames and `Scroll Delta This Frame`, as the wheel's guard reads them) beside it, and which reading the page headlines, is a protocol change for root `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
- **A short page's missing cells.** The tall table draws a value past a page's end as `NULL` (`render_body`'s `unwrap_or(CellValue::Null)`); the TanStack contender draws it empty. A static file never answers short, so nothing measured differs; whether the component should draw it empty too is the component's call (Tycho drives it).

- **The pill's compositor frames.** Throttled, the meter as a pill dropped more compositor frames than hidden on both sides (TanStack 7.98% against 3.5%, GPUI 4.21% against 0), while the open meter dropped none more (`perf/results/2026-10-21-m5-d4.md`). The pill isn't the default, so nothing gates it; whether it should get a layer of its own (`will-change: transform`, as the open meter has), and whether that's the cause, is untested.
- **A spread for a short mark.** The quiet-machine gate is (max − min) / median under 6% of each variant's open mark. TanStack's reference mark is ~500 ms, so one 15–30 ms stray fails it (7.0–7.7% in both D4 runs, while its gates read 0 against 0). Whether short marks get a floor in ms, or the gate uses the interquartile range over the median, is open.
- **The landing page.** The observatory's Worker holds the apex `seiza.io` (everything outside `/observatory/` a 404). The page is basic (a title, a catchy line, a link to the observatory), built in `site/landing/` on `site/ui/`'s shell (root `docs/DECISIONS.md`, "Repo structure"); when it ships is open. Shipping it moves the Worker to `site/worker/` and adds `/`, `/index.html`, and `/assets/` to the seiza.io WAF rule (`/fonts/` is in it already).
