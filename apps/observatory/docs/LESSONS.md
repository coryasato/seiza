# Lessons learned

One entry per milestone, written before starting the next one: what surprised us, and what it taught us. The milestone's numbers are in its results note (linked from each entry), and the decisions it made are in [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md).

<!-- Template:
## M<n>: <title> (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Results:** [`perf/results/<date>-m<n>.md`](../perf/results/<date>-m<n>.md)

**Surprises:**
- What didn't go as expected, and what it taught us. Numbers only where the surprise needs them; the rest are in the results note.

## M0: Groundwork: the app, its data file, and static hosting (2026-10-14)

**Results:** [`perf/results/2026-10-14-m0.md`](../perf/results/2026-10-14-m0.md)

**Surprises:**
- Workers static assets never answer a `Range` and never come from the edge cache, whatever `_headers` says. The plan's one stated assumption failed on the first production request; the documentation is silent on ranges either way, so only a deploy could tell. The fallback (a Worker in front, serving ranges from the edge cache) kept the file a static asset and read the first page faster than Tycho's R2 path, warm. Its cost is the first read at each location: 2.27 s, n = 1, worth measuring properly before the page ships.
- Local `wrangler dev` was worse than useless for this: no ranges either, and it gzips the Parquet, which production doesn't. Check range behavior only in production.
- A DNS lookup before the domain existed cached an NXDOMAIN on the local resolver for the zone's negative TTL (30 min), so the first checks failed with ENOTFOUND while the record was live. The scripts take `--resolve-via`.
- The code review of part A's first draft found one location spelled three ways (a path with the base for the bridge and the plugin, a directory for the script) that could disagree silently and turn the extension 404 off; one bare directory name for all three removed the class of bug.
